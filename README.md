# Is it a holiday?

This is an API to check if it is a holiday.

## API v1

It has one endpoint you care about:

```
/api/v1/check/:holiday/
```

The API will also accept a `timezone` parameter to check to see if 
it's still a holiday in the timezone where you live! The default 
timezone is set to `America/New_York`.

All API responses are in JSON.
